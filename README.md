# FastAndEasyFood

## Description

Site created as part of my engineering training using the Angular framework for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. The idea of the project was to imagine a system allowing users to order and pay for their meals online at the restaurant so as not to have to touch the menu in the context of a pandemic. So we designed an application based on Flutter for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. The application allows you to order dishes, pay for them online and pick them up at the restaurant. This site constitutes the admin part of the application. It allows you to manage dishes and customer orders and validate them.
